1)  System Requirements
================================================================================

1)  Introduction
================================================================================

2)  Prepare EasySCP test system
================================================================================
As we run automated tests against a test server we have to prepare the environment to allow certain access to the system
which should not be allowed on production systems. If you want to run these tests on a public available server you might
need to consider creating firewall rules which allow access to your testing host only.

1.  Install EasySCP
    Install a server with EasySCP.
    Follow the installation guide for your distribution until you reach the point 'Start the basic setup'. For our
    test server this step slightly differs.
    Run easyscp-setup.sh
        # ./easyscp-setup.sh

    Answer No to the question 'Secure your mysql installation [Y/N]?'. Do not finish your Setup now. This will be done
    later when running our automated tests.

2.  Allow remote connection to MySQL database
    Edit /etc/mysql/my.cnf and comment out the line containing the bind-address:
        #bind-address           = 127.0.0.1

    Connect to MySQL and run the following SQL statement:
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%'
            IDENTIFIED BY 'easyscp'
            WITH GRANT OPTION;
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    Restart MySQL Server
        # service mysql restart

================================================================================
3)  Prepare Testing system
---------------

1.  Install JRE
    To run the Selenium Standalone Server a JRE needs to be installed on your testing system.

2.  Download Selenium Standalone Server
    Download the latest version of Selenium Standalone Server from http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/

3.  Install Unit testing suite for PHP5 and Selenium RC integration for PHPUnit
    # apt-get install phpunit phpunit-selenium

4.  Update configuration
    Adjust environment specific information in the configuration file for your environment.

    If you want to use different usernames and passwords you might want to change information in common.conf

================================================================================
4)  Run tests
---------------
1.  Start Selenium Standalone Server
    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.50.1.jar

2.  Start EasySCP test system
    The best point to start with is a freshly installed server with EasySCP installed but not configured.

2.  Run phpunit tests
